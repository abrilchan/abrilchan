Hi, Iâ€™m Abril Chan (yes, that's my last name) :relaxed:

For the last six months I've been working on Front-End web development projects :computer: I have experience using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Also I've worked
with Firebase, Firestore, NodeJS, Jest and React. In case you want to know more about my projects, you can look the ones I'm most proud at my pinned  ðŸ“Œ

I've always been very passionated about science and tech, I am, in fact, a Physics Engineer :rocket: 
My interest are, in general, science and specifically astrophysics :waxing_crescent_moon: this passion led me to learn programming with Python. My undergrad thesis 
is a vey interesting analysis of variability in lightcurves. You can check it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxWdO5Uv5LJXx__O05n5OieXe_UkgOrr/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in programming, now as a web developer. And, of course, I'm open to collaborate on related projects :dizzy:

You can go to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrilchan/) profile to know more about my professional career or email me directly at abrilgallegos@gmail.com ðŸ“§
